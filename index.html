											<h2><a href="https://hz-voyager.itch.io/replayrecord", target="_blank" class="icon brands fa-itch-io">ReplayRecord</a></h2>
										</header>

										<img src="images/rrthumb3.png" alt="" width="475" height="374"/></span>

										<p>This was originally designed as a website with some friends while visiting Tokyo in August 2023. While its original idea was to be more of a backlogging 
											service, what I really wanted to implement was a robust activity log for it, much like the built-in ones for the 3DS and Wii U. So in October of the same year, 
											I took a few days to make a version of said concept using Qt's C++ library. The result is ReplayRecord, a simple activity log that keeps track of multiple gaming criteria. 
											It's design makes it easily scalable, and as such I do plan on iterating on it even more! As it is now, it's great and I've been using it to keep track of older games that 
											don't have built-in play timekeeping of any kind.<br><br>
											
											(Released in October 2023 for Windows)

											<h2><a href="https://hz-voyager.itch.io/sumutex", target="_blank" class="icon brands fa-itch-io">Sumutex</a></h2>
										</header>

										<img src="images/sumu.png" alt="" width="475" height="374"/></span>

										<p>A retro-styled arcade game. 
											I'm especially happy with how the "Sumutex" mode turned out, as that was actually not part of the original idea. 
											Its sort of nailbiting balance of patience, planning, and swiftness makes for a fun little challenge. A good opposite to the limited tutorial mode, "Redux".
										</p>

										<p>This game also features systems including:<br>
											High score saving<br>
											Complex background animations<br>
											And more, for a classic arcade experience!<br><br>
											(Released in July 2023 for Linux, Windows, Mac OS, and web browsers)

											<h2><a href="https://dynopunch.itch.io/project-summer-internal-test-1", target="_blank" class="icon brands fa-itch-io">Summer Scramble</a></h2>
										</header>

										<img src="images/ssgameplay.png" alt="" width="475" height="374"/></span>

										<p>A work-in-progress adventure game made as part of Dynochannel. It's temporarily on hiatus as members of the team began to pursue other projects, 
											however within a month we built an entire, functional overworld movement and dialogue system. I mostly helped programmed these along with an early version of the 
											game's minigame-styled RPG battle system, along with writing proper minigames you can play in the overworld. Needless to say, I'm rather proud 
											of my work on the project, and look forward to continuing working on it in the near future.<br><br>

											(Demo released in March 2023 for web browsers)
