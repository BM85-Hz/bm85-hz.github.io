										<p>Horror game demo created as part of my senior project during a few weeks of Spring 2023. The movement system was tricky to get working the way I wanted, 
											and I ended up having to learn how quaternions work as a result. No regrets!<br><br>
											The demo shows off the game's various features, including:<br>
											-Fully featured objective system<br>
											-Complete movement and shooting mechanics<br>
											-Interactive 3D map<br>
											-Chaser enemy AI<br><br>
											(Made in Unity using C#)

										</header>

										<p>Pilot is a C-based language implemented using the custom compiler, Compilotron. Compilotron features lexical analysis,
											syntax analysis, semantic analysis and basic intermediate code generation. This was all accomplished using the tools Bison and Flex.<br><br>

										<p>Simple raytracer and graphics pipeline implemented in C++. The user is able to pass in a .txt file that describes the object you want to render, 
											and the program will produce a corresponding image. The reflective and transparency shaders were easily the hardest for me, but getting that 
											authentic glass appearance was very rewarding.<br><br>

										</header>

										<img src="images/bee.png" alt="" width="475" height="374"/></span>

										<p>Made in just three days for Mini Jam 110, a few friends and I worked out a simple Breakout-style game with some really unique mechanics. 
											I spent most of the time improving the collision as well as tweaking the core gameplay design (especially the scoring system and the idea of having a limited stock of 
											balls you could shoot in rapid succession, which came from me).<br><br>
											
											The actual story of the game was made to fit with the game jam theme of sacrifice (as were the mechanics). And thus, no queen bees were harmed in making this game.<br><br>

											(Created in July 2022 using Unity and C#)

										<p>For a short while during and after an embedded systems class I took, I created some simple Arduino versions of various popular games. 
											Funnily enough, Wordle was a real challenge to get working, but only because the LCD screen I had was very sensitive and would crash a lot, 
											showing garbage characters instead. Stacker was surprisingly more fun to get going because I went ahead and hooked up an NES controller 
											to the hardware that made playing the game a lot more natural.<br><br>
											(These were made in early 2022 using C)<br><br>
											Not shown here, but also of note were a set of minigames I had running on a Raspberry Pi using a similar breadboard set up in 2019. 
											Those games were written in ARM Assembly and while they were cool, I sadly never took the opportunity to document them in any way.
